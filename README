ABOUT

	This small tool is used to seach/download some LaTeX packages that were listed in
		http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/ (or its mirror)
	or search/download any files in http://ctan.org/tex-archive

	Since version 1.0.1 this tool uses the cache http://viettug.org/ctan.tools//cache.tbz.
	This file contains the list of all files in CTAN. It's updated daily by a cron job
	hosted by VietTUG <http://viettug.org/>. The size of file is about 400k.

	The tool requires following tools to work correctly
		lynx wget tar bzip2 sed sort gawk grep
	Some linux distributions require that you install lynx manually.
