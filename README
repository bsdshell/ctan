ABOUT

	This small tool is used to seach some LaTeX packages that were listed in CTAN:
		 http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/.

	The tool requires wget, lynx, gawk, wc and sed program to run correctly.
	Some linux distribution doesnot contains lynx by default
	and you must install lynx manually before running ./ctan.

	So this tool requires a *nix-liked environment to work.
