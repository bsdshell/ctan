ABOUT

	This small tool is used to seach/download some LaTeX packages that were listed in CTAN:
		http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/
	or search/download for any files in
		http://ctan.org/tex-archive/.

	Since version 1.0.1, the tools will use the cache file
		http://kyanh.net/ctan.tools//dump_files.tbz
	This file contains the list of all files in CTAN. It's updated daily by a cron job hosted
	by http://kyanh.net/. The size of file is about 3MB (compressed) & 15MB (un-compressed).

	The tool requires wget, lynx, gawk, wc, tar/bzip and sed program to run correctly.
	Some linux distribution doesnot contains lynx by default and you must install lynx manually
	before running this script.

	So this tool requires a *nix-liked environment to work.

	This tool was written by kyanh <xkyanh@gmail.com>
	kyanh is a member of Vietnamese TeX Users Group <http://viettug.org>.
	He wrote this script as he wanted a fast client to access CTAN.
